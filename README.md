# Time_series_forecast:
Here, we analyze time series data and format it for training a DeepAR algorithm; a forecasting algorithm that utilizes a recurrent neural network. Train a model to predict household energy consumption patterns and evaluate the results.

Energy Consumption Data:
The data we'll be working with in this notebook is data about household electric power consumption, over the globe. The dataset is originally taken from Kaggle, and represents power consumption collected over several years from 2006 to 2010. With such a large dataset, we can aim to predict over long periods of time, over days, weeks or months of time. Predicting energy consumption can be a useful task for a variety of reasons including determining seasonal prices for power consumption and efficiently delivering power to people, according to their predicted usage.
